**Note: :warning: This project is under development.**

An API component for [Employee Scheduling](https://github.com/martinmicunda/employee-scheduling) application that makes employee scheduling and management easy, fast and mobile. The UI component for this application can be found [here](https://github.com/martinmicunda/employee-scheduling-ui). I wrote a few blog posts about this project and they can be found on my [blog](http://martinmicunda.com).
